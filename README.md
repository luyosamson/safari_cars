##### SAFARI CARS
Safari cars is  a website that offers car hire services.It is located in Nairobi.
This project was developed during Phase 2 bootcamp at Moringa School under software engineering programm.The main technologies applied here was react and it's related elements like react-dom router an react icons.

##### PPROJECT DESCRIPTION

First of all,I would like to clarify that this project is in its preliminary stages of development.This is just version 1 of many versions to come.

##### What it does.
Safari cars offer flexibility car reservation platform for clients who may need cars for 
tour,travelling of for other functions.The platform provide description of cars based on capacity,speed,colour(their are people who prefer particular colours of cars) and fee charged per day.
The client log into the platform,and get a variety of cars.One makes decision on the vehicle based on the description of the vehicle provided under each vehicle.
With this kind of platform,I believe hiring vehicle will not be a burden to those who need to do so.
Problems do arise during festive season when the demand of vehicle is always higher while locating a company offering such services become a burden to customers.
